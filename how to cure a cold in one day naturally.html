<h1>What Causes A Cold?</h1>
<p>The common cold is named common for a good reason. There are over a billion cold worldwide each year. Occassionally, someone you know will be down with a cold. Colds are the most common reason that children miss school or parents being abcence for work.</p>
<p>Children are more prone to cold due to the weaker immune system that they have. Usually, cold are spread from children to children when they are in contact with other childrens during school hours.</p>
<p>Cold is very common and can occur at any time of the year, but they mostly happen during winter or rainy seasons.</p>
<p>A cold virus spreads through tiny, air droplets that are released when the sick person sneezes, cough, or blow their nose.</p>
<p>Usual ways of catching a cold:
	<ul>
		<li>A person with a cold sneezes, coughs or blow their nose near you.</li>
		<li>You touch something that is contaminated by the virus and subsequently touched your nose, eye, or mouth.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>The cold is the most contagious for the first 2 to 3 days. It would not be contagious after a week.</p>
<p>Most people do not understand why they got a cold but mainly the reason is caused by a low immune system. When you have a low immune system, you system is not able to fight off the virus initially. The virus gains control causing you to have a cold. The body then realise that the virus is getting control and your protective body system comes into action and eradicate the virus. Most colds go away in a few days.</p> 
<p>However, what can you do to make the cold go away faster?</p>
<h1>Nautral Treatment For Colds</h1>
<h3>Feed a cold, starve a fever</h3>

<h3>Taking vitamin C</h3>
<p>In a double blind study of taking viatmin C, it did not reduce the incidence of the common cold. However, it did significantly reduce the length of colds. When taking vitamin C, it leads to the increase in growth of T cells, which are white blood cells involved in your immune response, as well as an increase production of interferon, which causes virus-infected cells to ramp up their anti-viral defenses. The best way to obtain vitamin C is by taking whole foods which are rich in vitamin C. Vitamin C tablets is possible, but the better alternative is whole food. Whole food consist of food that are not processes such as fruits and vegetables. Lemon can be a good source of vitamin C. It is good to take whole fruits as the nutrition obtained is not restricted to vitamin C, it includes other nutritional value that the whole fruit have.</p>

<div>If you are in need for a relief from cough or respiratory infection, honey has your back. Known for it's antibacterial activity, it increases the release of inflammatory cytokines, which signal cells to repair themselves.</div>
<p>There are many different grades of honey. Ever wondered why one bottle of honey cost so much more than the one beside it? Not all honey are good for health, some 'honey' just acts as a sweetner like sugar. The honey that should be taken is <strong>Raw Organic Honey</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Look at the ingredients and description, a retailer that produces <a href="https://iherb.co/3m5R1VMt">raw organic honey</a> will display it to showcase their product. Honey that are filtered or just named 'honey' may have been added with High Fructose Corn Syrup(HFCS), made from genetically modified corn. Honey taste is then being added to make it taste more like honey. Choose Raw Organic Honey instead of Honey, it makes a difference. When you have time, take the 2 different bottles of honey and give it a sniff. You can immediately tell the difference.</p>
